With a sequence of clickstream events performed by a user on an e commerce website, following are the business outcomes which would be addressed.<br>
1.Predicting whether the customer would be making some purchase or not.<br>
2.If yes what are the items that are going to be bought.<br>

As part of this project we are analyzing clickstream data for a large-scale ecommerce retailer in Europe which was published as part of the RecSys 2015 challenge. <br>

This data comprises a large collection of user visits to the European retailerâ€™s website and records a sequence of events on users clicks. The data records the clickstream events for a period of six months in 2014 for the retailer website and also includes the buying events for some of the sessions thus describing more about the purchased items.
